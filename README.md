It's easier to contribute [GraphQLite](https://github.com/thecodingmachine/graphqlite) and use it [Swoole](https://github.com/thecodingmachine/graphqlite/issues/569#issuecomment-1472785114), or [optimize the existing GraphQLite codebase](https://github.com/thecodingmachine/graphqlite/issues/569).

Another solution is to develop a [GraphQL server with Golang](https://github.com/99designs/gqlgen) and use it either as a PHP extension or as a [Docker](https://github.com/docker) microservice.
